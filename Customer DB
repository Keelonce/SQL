In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS JAN_Sales
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT COUNT(product) AS iPhones_Sold_JAN
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE length(Feb.orderid) = 6
AND Feb.orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE length(Jan.orderid) = 6
AND Jan.orderid<> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)* price AS total_rev
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
WHERE length(Jan.orderid) = 6
AND Jan.orderid<> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

SELECT product, quantity, price, SUM(quantity*price) AS tot_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';


SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE quantity>2
AND length(feb.orderid) =6
AND feb.orderid<>'Order ID'
